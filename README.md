# EmotionSense-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions from facial expressions. It utilizes real-time video footage to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. The system is designed to aid in understanding human emotions through advanced machine learning techniques.
